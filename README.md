# COEN352-Assignment1
 Series of Algorithm programming questions: Infix fix, Deleting Kth element of a list, Finding the max value of a linkedlist, josephus problem, and finding a value in a Bitonic array.

Question 1)
for an input such as: "1 + 2 ) * 3 - 4 ) * 5 - 6 ) ) )", output the correct corresponding string with the correctly placed left hand parenthese. 
Commonly known as InfixFix.

Question 2)
Deleteing the Kth element of a custom linkedlist. implemented using a for loop to get to the element and then deleting it. Also implemented away to delete the node by its value/

Question 3)
Finding the max value of a custom LinkedList.

Question 4)
Implementation of the josephus problem. For more info about the problem look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20named%20after,living%20in%20the%201st%20century.&text=Josephus%20states%20that%20by%20luck,Romans%20rather%20than%20killing%20themselves.
Implemented in two ways: 
 1) using a for loop (not indexed at zero) to find and keep track of the person killed.
 2) A recurisve implementation (zero indexed) that finds and keeps track of the person killed.
 
Question 5)
Finding an element in a bitonic array in 2log(n) time. Implements 3 different binary searches to find the bitonic point, and to search the right and left sides of the array.
